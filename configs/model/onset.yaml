label_smoothing_sigma: 2  # Gaussian smoothing width in frames (sharper peaks)
pos_weight: 1.0  # No class reweighting — Gaussian smoothing already covers timing tolerance

# Inference
onset_threshold: 0.35  # Lower threshold for conservative model (precision > recall)
min_onset_distance_ms: 50  # Minimum gap between onsets
min_onset_distance_frames: 5  # Minimum frames between predicted onsets
