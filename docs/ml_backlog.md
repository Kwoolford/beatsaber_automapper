# ML pipeline — backlog and carried-forward diagnoses

Moved out of `TODO.md` on 2026-09-16 (curation). **Deprioritised by Kyle 2026-08-20; do not queue from `/todo`.** If an agent-path item needs one of these, say so and stop.

## 🔵 C — ML-SIDE DIAGNOSES CARRIED FORWARD (landmines only; not being worked)

### C1 — Precision sits at the greedy optimum; gains need better probabilities, not better picking
Three decode levers moved onset precision by nothing; the IOI prior moved it *down* to 0.769.
**Stop hunting decode knobs.** The ~10 correct-tempo alignment failures are a **pure selection
defect**, established by elimination — not tempo, not phase, **not onset supply** (4.5 onsets
available per note we emit), and **not difficulty**.

### C2 — Grid PHASE: resolved ON THE METRIC ONLY, and its successor suspect is REFUTED
`BEAT_GRID_PHASE=search` fixed ~18 of 39 failing songs by the alignment axis, and he still reported
*"slightly off beat"*. Tempo is refuted as the cause too: on all four maps he played the bpm is
**exactly** the human's and our note times match a human's **better than two humans match each
other**. ⇒**Do not flip it on the axis alone.** ⚠️Never apply a blanket global shift — that part is
an **onset-detector offset**, and "fixing" it is the `h_dist` failure.
★**2026-08-20 adds**: `mapjudge` cannot adjudicate this at all — its only response to a global shift
is `offgrid_frac`, which moves **by construction**.

### C3 — You cannot thin your way to human density
Humans at 3.9 nps have a pulse; we at 3.9 do not, and **2026-08-20 reproduced this on 23 maps built
with no ML in the path at all**. Now the D1 query's mechanism.

### C4 — Beat-domain axes LIE on tempo errors
Every beat-domain axis buckets by the **map's own beats**, so on the **28 half-tempo songs** every
interval lands one bucket off. ⇒**When a beat-domain axis moves on a cohort containing tempo errors,
check whether the BPM moved first.**

### C5 — Doubles: root cause found · decode fix FAILED · priced against D4
**Not too many notes — too few distinct times.** Stage-1's two hand channels correlate
**0.985–0.993**. **39.6 % of the notes we spend on the vocal line are doubles** onto an onset the
other hand already covered (human 20.7 %). `BEAT_HAND_DEAL` hit every structural target and degraded
rhythm 6× ⇒ **not reachable by decode**. ★A **chain** is the human's alternative — one swing carrying
4–5 segments; `chains.py` builds them.

## 🧊 BACKLOGGED — ML PIPELINE (deprioritised by Kyle, 2026-08-20)
**Not dead, not being worked.** These are the model-training items; Kyle redirected the loop to the
agentic suite mid-session. Each keeps its measured evidence so it can be resumed without re-deriving
anything. ⚠️**Do not queue any of these from `/todo`.** If an agent-path item needs one of these to
progress, say so and stop — that is a decision for Kyle, not a silent re-prioritisation.

### 🧊 D4 — the ML generator does not follow the vocal line (training-side only)
Every alternative is eliminated by measurement: decode saturates (5× lower threshold buys **+4
notes**), the 1/4-beat grid is only **26–33 %** full, Track B at matched budget is **parity**, and
**Stage-1 does not modulate density per song at all (r = 0.046)** while crude audio features reach
**R² = 0.185**. We emit **0.217** positives per (slot,hand) against a corpus label mean of **0.245**
and these songs' humans at **0.294**.
⬜**PROPOSED RETRAIN, deliberately NOT queued**: an auxiliary per-song **density target** / FiLM
conditioning on the song's own label rate.
**DoD**: per-song nps correlation rises from 0.046 toward the demonstrated ≈0.43 floor **AND**
vocal coverage rises, at ≥3 seeds. ⚠️Must not regress the density he accepted (6.18 = unplayable;
current lever sits at 4.06).

### 🧊 TEMPO — priced, and smaller than its reputation
Right on **70.5 %** of songs (n=149). `BEAT_SUBDIV_AUTO` already recovers 16 of the 28 half-tempo
songs and is worth **+0.030 cohort-wide**; the remaining 12 are worth a further **+0.025** — about
**a fortieth of the human gap**. 🔴**Cheap detection is exhausted** (raw bpm AUC 0.978, 16/28 at
zero false fires; widening to bpm<110 costs 10 false fires for 8 songs). ⇒**Do not widen the
trigger.** ⚠️`notes per second` scores AUC 0.903 and catches **zero** at an affordable FP rate —
★*AUC is not an operating point.*

### Also backlogged
- **The two validated-but-unflipped ML levers** — `BEAT_SUBDIV_AUTO=1` (+0.222 vocal coverage at
  49x the seed sd on the 15 half-tempo songs it fires on) and `--beat-threshold 0.25` (+0.029 at
  8.6x sd). Both passed their DoDs; both change the **ML generator**, not the agent, so they wait.
- **C1 / C2 / C4 / C5 below** are ML-pipeline diagnoses, kept for their landmines only. C3 is the
  exception: it reproduced with **no ML in the path at all** and is live as **P0.5**.
